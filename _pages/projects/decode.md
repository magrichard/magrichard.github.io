This project aims to develop an innovative computational strategy to identify and model the molecular regulatory networks and cell interactions controlling the identity and physiological functions of cell types. To overcome existing biological and analytical challenges, the complementary expertise of the three partners in immunology, computer science, statistics, and mathematical modeling will be leveraged. We will focus on plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), whose identity and functions are controversial due to their high plasticity. The approach includes quantitative molecular profiling of pDC activation states according to their microenvironment and the development of original algorithmic methods.
