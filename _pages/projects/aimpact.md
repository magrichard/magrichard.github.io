Tumor cell plasticity is the ability of cancer cells to dynamically reprogram their transcriptional
programs in response to environmental cues. It is a key driver of therapy resistance and tumor
evolution across multiple cancer types. The complexity of tumor cell plasticity presents a significant
analytical challenge that conventional methods struggle to address due to their limited capacity to
model dynamic state transitions in high-dimensional biological data. Advanced artificial intelligence
approaches are uniquely positioned to decipher the complex, nonlinear relationships governing cancer
cell state transitions.
<br><br>
Building on our established expertise in cancer biology and computational modeling, our project aims
to develop breakthrough artificial intelligence methods that integrate gene regulatory network analysis,
spatial transcriptomics, and explainable machine learning techniques to characterize, interpret, and
predict cellular state transitions in solid tumors. We will address three key technical challenges:
uncertainty quantification in biological networks, interpretability of complex AI models, and integration
of spatial context with molecular dynamics. Our primary focus is on Pancreatic adenocarcinoma
(PDAC), one of the most lethal malignancies, for which we have deep expertise and access to rich
single-cell and spatial transcriptomic datasets. Importantly our framework is designed to be
generalizable to other cancer types.
Beyond methodological advances, we will establish rigorous benchmarking frameworks and develop
open-source software tools to foster community adoption and scientific reproducibility. To catalyze
collaborative science and accelerate innovation, we will organize scientific competitions that bring
together diverse expertise from the AI and biomedical communities, creating a dynamic platform for
methodological advancement and knowledge exchange. This interdisciplinary approach, at the
interface between artificial intelligence, bioinformatics, and oncology, will decipher the molecular and
spatial mechanisms governing tumor plasticity. Ultimately, our work will pave the way for novel
therapeutic strategies and personalized medicine while contributing to the development of a national
ecosystem for AI innovation in oncology research.
