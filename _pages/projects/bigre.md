The BIGRE (Computational Biology in Grenoble) network brings together researchers from multiple
laboratories to address key methodological challenges in life sciences data analysis. Over the
past two years, BIGRE has established a vibrant scientific community through seminars, coworking
sessions, and the annual BIGRE Days, fostering collaborations across laboratories and disciplines.
<br><br>
Building on this foundation, the proposed four-year Equipe-Action aims to strengthen local synergies,
consolidate expertise, and advance computational methods addressing four core bottlenecks:
(i) confounding factors and causal inference in high-dimensional data, (ii) multimodal data integration,
(iii) functional genome and ecosystem annotation, and (iv) analysis of spatially resolved
ecological and biological data. The initiative will leverage scientific animation, support Master’s internships,
and fund a two-year research chair to catalyze methods development and train the next
generation of computational biologists. Through these efforts, BIGRE seeks to reinforce Grenoble’s
position as a national hub in computational biology, foster methodological breakthroughs, and
ensure the long-term sustainability of the community.
