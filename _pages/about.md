I am a bioinformatician with a background in molecular biology and genetics, specialized in computational biology. Since 2018, I have been a CNRS researcher, focusing on tumor heterogeneity through the integration of experimental and computational approaches. My research spans both the development of novel methodological frameworks and the study of cancer biology.

      Laboratoire d'Informatique de Grenoble
    </a>
    to establish a bioinformatics group named <a href="https://bioinfo-lig.github.io/" target="_blank">
      Bioinfo@APTIKAL
    </a> , with my colleague Antoine Frénoy.
    Our group is part of the team

## Research environment 


I am actively involved in the network [BiGre](https://bi-gre.github.io/) (Computational Biology in Grenoble).


I am also actively engaged in promoting collaborative science by organizing data challenges. I am a director of [ChaLearn](http://www.chalearn.org/) organisation, and an administrator of the [Academic Committee for Data Challenges](https://gricad.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/en/research-support/acdc/) of the University Grenoble Alpes.
