This paper presents a two-step procedure for high-dimensional mediation analysis. The first step selects a reduced number of candidate mediators using an ad-hoc lasso penalty. The second step applies a procedure we previously developed to estimate the mediated and direct effects, accounting for the correlation structure among the retained candidate mediators.
