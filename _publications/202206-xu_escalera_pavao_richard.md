 We introduce Codabench, a meta-benchmark platform, that is capable of flexible and easy benchmarking and supports reproducibility. Codabench is an important step toward benchmarking and reproducible research. It has been used in various communities including graph machine learning, cancer heterogeneity, clinical diagnosis, and reinforcement learning. Codabench is ready to help trendy research, e.g., artificial intelligence (AI) for science and data-centric AI.
