This manuscript describes a novel method, named PenDA, to perform differential analysis of gene expression at the individual level. In PenDA, a gene is considered as deregulated in one sample of interest (e.g., a tumor) if its local ordering relatively to other genes with similar expressions is perturbed compared to its ordering in a set of control samples (e.g., normal tissues).
