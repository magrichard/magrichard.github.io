	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Quantification of tumor heterogeneity is essential to better understand cancer progression and to adapt therapeutic treatments to patient specificities. Bioinformatic tools to assess the different cell populations from single-omic datasets as bulk transcriptome or methylome samples have been recently developed, including reference-based and reference-free methods. Improved methods using multi-omic datasets are yet to be developed in the future and the community would need systematic tools to perform a comparative evaluation of these algorithms on controlled data.
RESULTS: We present DECONbench, a standardized unbiased benchmarking resource, applied to the evaluation of computational methods quantifying cell-type heterogeneity in cancer. DECONbench includes gold standard simulated benchmark datasets, consisting of transcriptome and methylome profiles mimicking pancreatic adenocarcinoma molecular heterogeneity, and a set of baseline deconvolution methods (reference-free algorithms inferring cell-type proportions). DECONbench performs a systematic performance evaluation of each new methodological contribution and provides the possibility to publicly share source code and scoring.
CONCLUSION: DECONbench allows continuous submission of new methods in a user-friendly fashion, each novel contribution being automatically compared to the reference baseline methods, which enables crowdsourced benchmarking. DECONbench is designed to serve as a reference platform for the benchmarking of deconvolution methods in the evaluation of cancer heterogeneity. We believe it will contribute to leverage the benchmarking practices in the biomedical and life science communities. DECONbench is hosted on the open source Codalab competition platform.

Important properties of gene regulatory networks can be captured by computational models. If model parameters can be "personalized" according to the genotype, their variation may then reveal how DNA variants operate in the network. Here, we combined experiments and computations to visualize natural alleles of the yeast GAL3 gene in a space of model parameters describing the galactose response network. Alleles altering the activation of Gal3p by galactose were discriminated from those affecting its activity (production/degradation or efficiency of the activated protein). The approach allowed us to correctly predict that a non-synonymous SNP would change the binding affinity of Gal3p with the Gal80p transcriptional repressor. Our results illustrate how personalizing gene regulatory models can be used for the mechanistic interpretation of genetic variants.},

	abstract = {Living systems control cell growth dynamically by processing information from their environment. Although responses to a single environmental change have been intensively studied, little is known about how cells react to fluctuating conditions. Here, we address this question at the genomic scale by measuring the relative proliferation rate (fitness) of 3,568 yeast gene deletion mutants in out-of-equilibrium conditions: periodic oscillations between two environmental conditions. In periodic salt stress, fitness and its genetic variance largely depended on the oscillating period. Surprisingly, dozens of mutants displayed pronounced hyperproliferation under short stress periods, revealing unexpected controllers of growth under fast dynamics. We validated the implication of the high-affinity cAMP phosphodiesterase and of a regulator of protein translocation to mitochondria in this group. Periodic oscillations of extracellular methionine, a factor unrelated to salinity, also altered fitness but to a lesser extent and for different genes. The results illustrate how natural selection acts on mutations in a dynamic environment, highlighting unsuspected genetic vulnerabilities to periodic stress in molecular processes that are conserved across all eukaryotes.},

	abstract = {The Wnt and Hedgehog signaling pathways are essential for normal development and are misregulated in cancer. The casein kinase family of serine/threonine kinases regulates both pathways at multiple levels. However, it has been difficult to determine whether individual members of this family have distinct functions in vivo, due to their overlapping substrate specificities. In Drosophila melanogaster, photoreceptor differentiation is induced by Hedgehog and inhibited by Wingless, providing a sensitive system in which to identify regulators of each pathway. We used a mosaic genetic screen in the Drosophila eye to identify mutations in genes on the X chromosome required for signal transduction. We recovered mutations affecting the transcriptional regulator CREB binding protein, the small GTPase dynamin, the cytoskeletal regulator Actin-related protein 2, and the protein kinase Casein kinase 1α. Consistent with its reported function in the β-Catenin degradation complex, Casein Kinase 1α mutant cells accumulate β-Catenin and ectopically induce Wingless target genes. In contrast to previous studies based on RNA interference, we could not detect any effect of the same Casein Kinase 1α mutation on Hedgehog signaling. We thus propose that Casein kinase 1α is essential to allow β-Catenin degradation and prevent inappropriate Wingless signaling, but its effects on the Hedgehog pathway are redundant with other Casein kinase 1 family members.},

	abstract = {The number of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) present in the plasma membrane of muscle and neuronal cells is limited by the assembly of individual subunits into mature pentameric receptors. This process is usually inefficient, and a large number of the synthesized subunits are degraded by endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation. To identify cellular factors required for the synthesis of AChRs, we performed a genetic screen in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans for mutants with decreased sensitivity to the cholinergic agonist levamisole. We isolated a partial loss-of-function allele of ER membrane protein complex-6 (emc-6), a previously uncharacterized gene in C. elegans. emc-6 encodes an evolutionarily conserved 111-aa protein with two predicted transmembrane domains. EMC-6 is ubiquitously expressed and localizes to the ER. Partial inhibition of EMC-6 caused decreased expression of heteromeric levamisole-sensitive AChRs by destabilizing unassembled subunits in the ER. Inhibition of emc-6 also reduced the expression of homomeric nicotine-sensitive AChRs and GABAA receptors in C. elegans muscle cells. emc-6 is orthologous to the yeast and human EMC6 genes that code for a component of the recently identified ER membrane complex (EMC). Our data suggest this complex is required for protein folding and is connected to ER-associated degradation. We demonstrated that inactivation of additional EMC members in C. elegans also impaired AChR synthesis and induced the unfolded protein response. These results suggest that the EMC is a component of the ER folding machinery. AChRs might provide a valuable proxy to decipher the function of the EMC further.},

We demonstrated that the CRLD-1A isoform is a membrane-associated ER-resident protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). It physically interacts with AChRs and promotes the assembly of AChR subunits in the ER. Mutations of Creld1, the human ortholog of crld-1a, are responsible for developmental cardiac defects. We showed that Creld1 knockdown in mouse muscle cells decreased surface expression of AChRs and that expression of mouse Creld1 in C. elegans rescued crld-1a mutant phenotypes. Altogether these results identify a novel and evolutionarily-conserved maturational enhancer of AChR biogenesis, which controls the abundance of functional receptors at the cell surface.},

	abstract = {Background: Cell-type heterogeneity of tumors is a key factor in tumor progression and response to chemotherapy. Tumor cell-type heterogeneity, defined as the proportion of the various cell-types in a tumor, can be inferred from DNA methylation of surgical specimens. However, confounding factors known to associate with methylation values, such as age and sex, complicate accurate inference of cell-type proportions. While reference-free algorithms have been developed to infer cell-type proportions from DNA methylation, a comparative evaluation of the performance of these methods is still lacking.
Results: Here we use simulations to evaluate several computational pipelines based on the software packages MeDeCom, EDec, and RefFreeEWAS. We identify that accounting for confounders, feature selection, and the choice of the number of estimated cell types are critical steps for inferring cell-type proportions. We find that removal of methylation probes which are correlated with confounder variables reduces the error of inference by 30–35\%, and that selection of cell-type informative probes has similar effect. We show that Cattell’s rule based on the scree plot is a powerful tool to determine the number of cell-types. Once the pre-processing steps are achieved, the three deconvolution methods provide comparable results. We observe that all the algorithms’ performance improves when inter-sample variation of cell-type proportions is large or when the number of available samples is large. We find that under specific circumstances the methods are sensitive to the initialization method, suggesting that averaging different solutions or optimizing initialization is an avenue for future research.
Conclusion: Based on the lessons learned, to facilitate pipeline validation and catalyze further pipeline improvement by the community, we develop a benchmark pipeline for inference of cell-type proportions and implement it in the R package medepir.},

	abstract = {Despite the recent progress in sequencing technologies, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) remain limited by a statistical-power issue: many polymorphisms contribute little to common trait variation and therefore escape detection. The small contribution sometimes corresponds to incomplete penetrance, which may result from probabilistic effects on molecular regulations. In such cases, genetic mapping may benefit from the wealth of data produced by single-cell technologies. We present here the development of a novel genetic mapping method that allows to scan genomes for single-cell Probabilistic Trait Loci that modify the statistical properties of cellular-level quantitative traits. Phenotypic values are acquired on thousands of individual cells, and genetic association is obtained from a multivariate analysis of a matrix of Kantorovich distances. No prior assumption is required on the mode of action of the genetic loci involved and, by exploiting all single-cell values, the method can reveal non-deterministic effects. Using both simulations and yeast experimental datasets, we show that it can detect linkages that are missed by classical genetic mapping. A probabilistic effect of a single SNP on cell shape was detected and validated. The method also detected a novel locus associated with elevated gene expression noise of the yeast galactose regulon. Our results illustrate how single-cell technologies can be exploited to improve the genetic dissection of certain common traits. The method is available as an open source R package called ptlmapper.},

This source of variation is becoming more and more apparent thanks to the recent advances in dynamic imaging and single-cell analysis. Some of these studies showed that the link between genotype and phenotype is not strictly deterministic. Mutations can change various statistical properties of a biochemical reaction, and thereby the probability of a trait outcome. The fact that they can modulate phenotypic noise brings up an intriguing question: how may selection act on these mutations? In this review, we approach this question by first covering the evidence that biological noise is under genetic control and therefore a substrate for evolution. We then sequentially inspect the possibilities of negative, neutral, and positive selection for mutations increasing biological noise. Finally, we hypothesize on the specific case of H2A.Z, which was shown to both buffer phenotypic noise and modulate transcriptional efficiency.},

These molecular subtypes were defined by RNAseq, a costly technique sensitive to sample quality and cellularity, not used in routine practice. To allow rapid PDAC molecular subtyping and study PDAC heterogeneity, we develop PACpAInt, a multi-step deep learning model. PACpAInt is trained on a multicentric cohort (n = 202) and validated on 4 independent cohorts including biopsies (surgical cohorts n = 148; 97; 126 / biopsy cohort n = 25), all with transcriptomic data (n = 598) to predict tumor tissue, tumor cells from stroma, and their transcriptomic molecular subtypes, either at the whole slide or tile level (112 µm squares). PACpAInt correctly predicts tumor subtypes at the whole slide level on surgical and biopsies specimens and independently predicts survival. PACpAInt highlights the presence of a minor aggressive Basal contingent that negatively impacts survival in 39\% of RNA-defined classical cases. Tile-level analysis ( {\textgreater} 6 millions) redefines PDAC microheterogeneity showing codependencies in the distribution of tumor and stroma subtypes, and demonstrates that, in addition to the Classical and Basal tumors, there are Hybrid tumors that combine the latter subtypes, and Intermediate tumors that may represent a transition state during PDAC evolution.},

	abstract = {Tumour heterogeneity significantly affects cancer progression and therapeutic response, yet quantifying it from bulk molecular data remains challenging. Deconvolution algorithms, which estimate cell-type proportions in bulk samples, offer a potential solution. However, there is no consensus on the optimal algorithm for transcriptomic or methylomic data. Here, we present an unbiased evaluation framework for the first comprehensive comparison of deconvolution algorithms across both omic types, including reference-based and -free approaches. Our evaluation covers raw performance, stability, and computational efficiency under varying conditions, such as missing or additional cell types and diverse sample compositions. We apply this framework across multiple benchmark datasets, including a novel multi-omics dataset generated specifically for this study. To ensure transparency and re-usability, we have designed a reproducible workflow using containerization and publicly available code. Our results highlight the strengths and limitations of various algorithms, and provides practical guidance for selecting the best method based on data type and analysis context. This benchmark sets a new standard for evaluating deconvolution methods and analysing tumour heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {Unsupervised deconvolution algorithms are often used to estimate cell composition from bulk tissue samples. However, applying cell-type deconvolution and interpreting the results remain a challenge, even more without prior training in bioinformatics. Here, we propose a tool for estimating and identifying cell type composition from bulk transcriptomes or methylomes. DECOMICS is a shiny-web application dedicated to unsupervised deconvolution approaches of bulk omic data. It provides (i) a variety of existing algorithms to perform deconvolution on the gene expression or methylation-level matrix, (ii) an enrichment analysis module to aid biological interpretation of the deconvolved components, based on enrichment analysis, and (iii) some visualization tools. Input data can be downloaded in csv format and preprocessed in the web application (normalization, transformation, and feature selection). The results of the deconvolution, enrichment, and visualization processes can be downloaded.DECOMICS is an R-shiny web application that can be launched (i) directly from a local R session using the R package available here: https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/Magali.Richard/decomics (either by installing it locally or via a virtual machine and a Docker image that we provide); or (ii) in the Biosphere—IFB Clouds Federation for Life Science, a multi-cloud environment scalable for high-performance computing: https://biosphere.france-bioinformatique.fr/catalogue/appliance/193/.},

	url = {https://hal.science/hal-04658960},
	abstract = {Mediation analysis plays a crucial role in epidemiology, unraveling the intricate path- ways through which exposures exert influence on health outcomes. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing techniques have generated growing interest in applying mediation analysis to explore the causal relationships between patient environmen- tal exposures, molecular features (such as omics data) and various health outcomes. Mediation analysis handling high-dimensional mediators raise a number of statistical challenges. Despite the emergence of numerous methods designed to tackle these challenges, the majority are limited to continuous outcomes. Furthermore, these ad- vanced statistical approaches have yet to find widespread adoption among epidemiol- ogists and health data scientists in their day-to-day practices. To address this gap, we introduce an R package specifically tailored for high-dimensional mediation analysis us- ing the max-squared method (HDMAX2). This tool aims to mitigate these obstacles by providing a practical solution for researchers and practitioners eager to explore intri- cate causal relationships in health data involving complex molecular features. Here we improve the HDMAX2 method, and expand its capabilities to accommodate multiple exposures and non-continuous variables. This improvement enables its application to a diverse array of mediation analysis scenarios, mirroring the complexity often encoun- tered in healthcare data. To enhance accessibility for users with varying expertise, we release an R package called hdmax2. This package allows users to estimate the indirect effects of mediators, calculate the overall indirect effect of mediators, and facilitates the execution of high-dimensional mediation analysis.},

	abstract = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) ranks among the most aggressive malignancies, characterized by exceptionally poor prognosis due to late diagnosis and therapeutic resistance. While tobacco exposure is an established risk factor for PDAC incidence and influences patient survival, the underlying molecular mechanisms mediating these effects remain poorly understood. We aimed to characterize the causal pathways linking tobacco exposure to PDAC patient survival, focusing on DNA methylation and tumor immune infiltration as potential mediators. For this purpose, we developed HDMAX2-surv, an extension of high-dimensional mediation analysis method HDMAX2, adapted to survival outcomes. Through extensive simulations across multiple scenarios, we demonstrated superior performance compared to existing methods in handling complex DNA methylation data. We integrated this approach with causal discovery frameworks and immune deconvolution algorithms to dissect multi-pathway mediation mechanisms. Using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort of 145 PDAC patients, we identified 37 aggregated methylated regions (AMRs) with significant mediation effects, exhibiting both protective and deleterious impacts on survival. Our causal discovery analysis revealed complex relationships where tobacco effects operate through sequential pathways involving DNA methylation and immune infiltration changes. Serial mediation analysis identified four distinct pathways where tobacco-induced epigenetic modifications mediate survival effects through immune microenvironment alterations, involving the HIST1H4E, NAA11, SPTBN2, and CHL1 loci. Remarkably, these effects were undetectable through gene expression analysis alone, highlighting the unique value of methylation-based approaches. This study provides dual contributions: methodologically, through the first integrated framework for high-dimensional survival mediation analysis with causal discovery; and biologically, by elucidating complex molecular mechanisms through which tobacco exposure influences PDAC outcomes. Our findings reveal the intricate interplay between environmental exposures, epigenetic modifications, and immune responses in cancer prognosis.},
